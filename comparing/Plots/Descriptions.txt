Samples{i}{j}(k = {n})

* i means the data comes from ith copula, 
the first copula is C(u, v; t) = min(u, tv + (1-t)(u + v - 1)_{+})
The second is max model, i.e. x_i, i = 1...n are iid  x := x_1 and y := max_{i<=n} x_i
The third is asymmetrize Gumbel

* j = XY means we are study asymmetric estimator "X->Y" j = YX means we are study estimator "Y->X" (since EDM does not depend on X->Y or Y->X, the data used in Xy and YX are the same)

* n means the number of the choosen tail samples
